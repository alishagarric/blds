Heâ€™s been involved in many projects involving discrimination measurement, algorithmic bias, disparity mitigation, and explainable AI in fields like credit, healthcare, and insurance.</p><p>Chris has had meaningful experience working on issues around fairness across government, at a law firm, and in consulting. He brings a blend of compliance experience from many fields and perspectives, alongside quantitative abilities that allow him to cross between worlds to be a highly effective data scientist.</p><p>Chris hopes to use his experience on both the regulatory and industry side of fair AI in fields like credit, healthcare, and marketing to help bridge the gap between academic ideals of fairness and how algorithms can be made more equitable in practice. Chris has an MS in Business Analytics.</p>",
